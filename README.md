# MiniEnD
Code for paper titled "Task-agnostic Distillation of Encoder-Decoder Language Models"

The code typically follows the pipeline of [MiniMA](https://github.com/GeneZC/MiniMA) with additional modeling files. 

Raise an issue if you are interested, otherwise you would learn from the distillation pipeline of MiniMA instead.
